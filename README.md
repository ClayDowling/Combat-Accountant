# Combat Accountant

Combat Accountant is a replacement for all of the chicken scratches that
wind up scribbled on notepads at the gaming table.  While the venerable
scratch pad has served us well, it's too easy to miss important things
using these manual methods.

Planned Features:

- Track all members of a combat, Player Characters and NPCs alike.
- Tracking for consumables, like ammunition and wand charges.
- Potions.  These are really another type of consumable, like bullets or
  wand charges, but they're a one and done type of thing, so they need a
  simplified interface.
- Tracking for hit points and similar traits.
- Experienced gained, with notes to put it in context.
- Important traits, such as challenge rating or target values for
  attacks.
- Flagging characters when critical values have been reached, such as 0
  hit points or 0 ammo.
